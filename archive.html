            <p class="date-heading">Refuctoring - Wednesday 3rd December 2014</p>
            <p>In this session, the group enjoyed coding up a nice, clean solution to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz">FizzBuzz</a> before mercilessly <a href="http://www.waterfall2006.com/gorman.html">refuctoring</a> it into an unrecognisable pile of tangled ASCII!  (Or in some cases, Unicode..)</p>
            <p>The solutions started out in Java, C#, F# and Haskell, but by the end could barely have been recognised as such by the language designers themselves.  There were many devious crimes against programming such as code which would only work one day of the month, source written in a variety of Unicode symbols, y-combinator abominations and plain old bad naming.</p>
            <p>We learned a few things about programming, and more importantly, had a lot of fun.</p>
            <p>Go and have a look at some of the <a href="https://github.com/LeedsCodeDojo/Refuctoring">solutions on github</a> - if you dare!</p>

            <p class="date-heading">The Pipe Packing Challenge - Thursday 6th November 2014</p>
            <p>In a coding session that took inspiration from the last <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Leeds-Sharp/events/199532112/">leeds sharp session</a>, five pairs of us wrote algorithms to try and solve a simplified version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem">bin packing problem.</a></p>
            <p>There were once again many languages in effect - Erlang, F#, C# and Haskell - and all of the pairs had a working solution by the end.  Most ended up with a 'First Fit' algorithm, which does a pretty good job of finding a solution to this NP-Hard problem without taking the age of the universe to run..</p>
            <p>Most of the <a href="https://github.com/LeedsCodeDojo/PipePacking">solutions are up on github</a> - go check them out!</p>

            <p class="date-heading">Build you a Skynet - Wednesday 1st October 2014</p>
            <p>We worked in twos and threes to write Machine Learning algorithms based on the k-nearest neighbours algorithm.  The group did well, with almost everyone getting a working solution, and some teams getting to over 90% accuracy with their digit classification!</p>
            <p>There were several languages in use - F#, Objective C, Scala, C#, and Python, and again a few people got involved with a new language, well done to them.</p>

            <p class="date-heading">Word Wrap Kata - Wednesday 3rd September 2014</p>
            <p>We paired up to tackle another problem using TDD and Pair Programming, this time looking at implementing a Word Wrap algorithm.  This takes a line of text and wraps it to a certain length - similar to how Notepad and other text editors work.</p>
            <p>As usual, there were several languages in use - C#, Python, and PHP, with a couple of folk trying out something new.  We also tried out the 'test list' technique, where you maintain a list of tests throughout the session, crossing them off and adding more as you go.</p>
            <p>The problem proved fairly interesting, with a few different techniques emerging - recursion seemed to work well and produce fairly simple solutions, and some people chose to return collections of strings with others going for a block of text.  The initial choice of test (and therefore implementation path) seemed to have quite a bit impact on how easy it was to get to a working solution.</p>

            <p class="date-heading">Fore! A nice round of Code Golf: Tuesday 5th August 2014</p>
            <p>We had a great round of code golf, with several languages represented - C#, Ruby, Python and Haskell.  We coded up solutions to <a href="http://golf.shinh.org/p.rb?99+shinichiroes+of+hamaji">output the '99 bottles' song</a>, then made them as small as possible!</p>
            <p>As you might predict, the Ruby and Python solutions were initially much smaller at 400-odd characters, but it was quite a struggle to get them down to the ultimate winner at 257 characters.  The C# and Haskell solutions on the other hand started out much larger at 1000-plus chars, but ended up only 50 or so characters behind the scripting languages.  It was an exciting race to the finish line!</p>
            <p>A couple of the <a href="https://github.com/LeedsCodeDojo/CodeGolf_99Bottles">solutions are up on github</a> - go and be impressed!</p>

            <p class="date-heading">The Dojo opens: Wednesday 9th July!</p>
            <p>The first Leeds Code Dojo went really well – 17 people joined in, from a variety of different backgrounds and of various skill levels, so a great response. The Callcredit boardroom was pretty much at capacity, we might need to get a bigger room for the next one!</p>
            <p>We worked in pairs on the ‘Kata Potter’ programming problem, practising the skills of TDD and Pair Programming. It was great to see a number of languages being used, including C#, F#, Ruby, Python, and PHP, with a few people trying out a new language for the first time.</p>
            <p>Several of the solutions are up on github - <a href="https://github.com/LeedsCodeDojo/KataPotter">go check them out!</a></p>
