            <p class="date-heading">ARCHIVE: The Dojo opens: Wednesday 9th July!</p>
            <p>The first Leeds Code Dojo went really well – 17 people joined in, from a variety of different backgrounds and of various skill levels, so a great response. The Callcredit boardroom was pretty much at capacity, we might need to get a bigger room for the next one!</p>
            <p>We worked in pairs on the ‘Kata Potter’ programming problem, practising the skills of TDD and Pair Programming. It was great to see a number of languages being used, including C#, F#, Ruby, Python, and PHP, with a few people trying out a new language for the first time.</p>
            <p>Several of the solutions are up on github - <a href="https://github.com/LeedsCodeDojo/KataPotter">go check them out!</a></p>

            <p>We had a great round of code golf, with several languages represented - C#, Ruby, Python and Haskell.  We coded up solutions to <a href="http://golf.shinh.org/p.rb?99+shinichiroes+of+hamaji">output the '99 bottles' song</a>, then made them as small as possible!</p>
            <p>As you might predict, the Ruby and Python solutions were initially much smaller at 400-odd characters, but it was quite a struggle to get them down to the ultimate winner at 257 characters.  The C# and Haskell solutions on the other hand started out much larger at 1000-plus chars, but ended up only 50 or so characters behind the scripting languages.  It was an exciting race to the finish line!</p>
            <p>A couple of the <a href="https://github.com/LeedsCodeDojo/CodeGolf_99Bottles">solutions are up on github</a> - go and be impressed!</p>

            <p class="date-heading">ARCHIVE: Word Wrap Kata - Wednesday 3rd September 2014</p>
            <p>We paired up to tackle another problem using TDD and Pair Programming, this time looking at implementing a Word Wrap algorithm.  This takes a line of text and wraps it to a certain length - similar to how Notepad and other text editors work.</p>
            <p>As usual, there were several languages in use - C#, Python, and PHP, with a couple of folk trying out something new.  We also tried out the 'test list' technique, where you maintain a list of tests throughout the session, crossing them off and adding more as you go.</p>
            <p>The problem proved fairly interesting, with a few different techniques emerging - recursion seemed to work well and produce fairly simple solutions, and some people chose to return collections of strings with others going for a block of text.  The initial choice of test (and therefore implementation path) seemed to have quite a bit impact on how easy it was to get to a working solution.</p>
            <p>Go and see the <a href="https://github.com/LeedsCodeDojo/WordWrap">solutions on github</a></p>
