            <p>"The first Leeds Code Dojo went really well – 17 people joined in, from a variety of different backgrounds and of various skill levels, so a great response. The Callcredit boardroom was pretty much at capacity, we might need to get a bigger room for the next one!</p>
            <p>We worked in pairs on the ‘Kata Potter’ programming problem, practising the skills of TDD and Pair Programming. It was great to see a number of languages being used, including C#, F#, Ruby, Python, and PHP, with a few people trying out a new language for the first time.</p>
            <p>Several of the solutions are up on github - go check them out!"</p>

            <p class="date-heading">ARCHIVE: Fore! A nice round of Code Golf: Tuesday 5th August 2014</p>
            <p>"In this session, we’ll be having a game of Code Golf, where the objective is to complete your program in as few (key)strokes as possible.</p>
            <p>Throw caution and good programming practice to the wind in your quest for an ever-decreasing character count! Well-named variables? Not today my friend. Sensibly modularised code structure? Hell no! Comments? You must be kidding...</p>
            <p>Although the main aim is to have fun, it’s also a great way to improve your language knowledge. Do you *really* need those parentheses? Is pattern matching more concise than an If? Isn’t there an operator that does this?!</p>
            <p>All these questions and more will be asked, and hopefully answered, on the night.</p>
            <p>Just bring your laptop if you have one, set up with our language of choice (including the ability to run unit tests). We’ll be working pairs, so don’t worry if you don’t have one.</p>
            <p>Doors are open from 18:00, and the night will kick off at 18:30 with pizza and socialising. We’ll get started on the coding at 19:00, starting with a description of code golf and the problem we’ll be golfing. We’ll then code up our solutions (ideally with a few unit tests to show it works) before squeezing them down as small as they will go!</p>
            <p>We’ll finish up around 21:00, and more than likely head to the pub afterwards."</p>
