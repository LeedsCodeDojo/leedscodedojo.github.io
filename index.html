            <h2>What?</h2>

            <p>Leeds Code Dojo is a group dedicated to programming.  We focus on practical coding sessions, where you can learn by doing.</p>


            <p>
                Want to have some fun coding in a relaxed and friendly environment? Interested in self-improvement through deliberate practice? Want to see what you can learn from fellow programmers, and teach them what you know? Then Leeds Code Dojo is for you!
            </p>

            <p>All languages and levels of experience welcome.</p>

            <h2>When?</h2>

            <h4>The Dojo opens: Wednesday 9th July!</h4>

            <p>
                This will be a practical coding session in the classic dojo style, where we pick a simple programming problem, then work on it together using the eXtreme Programming practices of TDD and Pair Programming.
            </p>

            <p>Although we will be working on a problem, the main focus is on improving our coding by focusing on these practices, and learning from each other.</p>

            <p>Doors are open from 18:00, and the night will kick off at 18:30 with coffee and socialising.  We'll get started on the coding at 19:00, kicking off with a brief overview of the techniques we'll be using and the problem we'll be looking at.  We'll code in pairs, using whatever languages people have available - so bring your laptop, if you have one, with your language of choice installed.  Please ensure you have some way of running unit tests.  One important point to note is that</p>

            <p>**WE HAVE NO INTERNET!**</p>

            <p>So whatever you have installed is what you'll have to get by with.</p>

            <p>
                This night is suitable for any level of experience, but you do need to know at least basic programming.  (No, not BASIC programming... :-p).
            </p>

            <p>
                We'll finish up around 21:00, and more than likely head to the pub afterwards.
            </p>

            <p>Pleces are limited, so please <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Leeds-Code-Dojo/events/191193442/"> register on meetup</a> if you'd like to come.</p>
