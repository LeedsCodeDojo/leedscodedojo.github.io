            <h2>What?</h2>

            <p>Leeds Code Dojo is a group dedicated to programming.  We focus on practical coding sessions, where you can learn by doing.</p>

            <p>
                Want to have some fun coding in a relaxed and friendly environment? Interested in self-improvement through deliberate practice? Want to see what you can learn from fellow programmers, and teach them what you know? Then Leeds Code Dojo is for you!
            </p>

            <br/>
            <p>From newbie Node coders to hardcore Haskell hackers, and all the levels of C#, Java, Ruby, Python or F# inbetween, all languages and abilities are welcome.</p>

            <h2>When?</h2>

            <h4>Next: The Pipe Packing Challenge - Thursday 6th November</h4>

            <p>
                Peter Piper Packed a Perfect Pack of Pristine Pipes.  And so will you, after taking part in the Pipe Packing Challenge!
            </p>
            <p>
                In a coding session taking inspiration* from the last <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Leeds-Sharp/events/199532112/">leeds sharp session</a>, this november we'll be writing algorithms to try and solve a simplified version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem">bin packing problem.</a></p>
            <p>
                We'll be working in pairs or small teams as usual.  Unit Testing/TDD is recommended but optional for this session, which should please those of you who are too clever to need tests (*cough* Matt *cough*).  The team with the most optimum solution by the end of the night will win.. A slice of (cold) pizza!  And of course the admiration of all involved.
            </p>
            <p>
                Doors are open from 18:00, and the night will kick off at 18:30 with food and chit-chat.  We'll get started on the coding around 19:00, starting with an explanation of the problem and how we'd like to you solve it.
            </p>

            <p>
                * Took inspiration, blatantly stole.. It's all coding fun, and that's the main thing, right?!
            </p>

            <p>Please <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Leeds-Code-Dojo/events/210949732/"> register on meetup</a> if you'd like to attend.</p>

            <h4>Previous: Build you a Skynet - Wednesday 1st October</h4>

            <p>
                We worked in twos and threes to write Machine Learning algorithms based on the k-nearest neighbours algorithm.  The group did well, with almost everyone getting a working solution, and some teams getting to over 90% accuracy with their digit classification!
            </p>
            <p>
                As usual, there were several languages in use - F#, Objective C, Scala, C#, and Python, and again a few people got involved with a new language, so well done to them.
            </p>
