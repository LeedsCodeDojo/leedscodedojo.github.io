            <h2>What?</h2>

            <p>Leeds Code Dojo is a group dedicated to programming.  We focus on practical coding sessions, where you can learn by doing.</p>

            <p>
                Want to have some fun coding in a relaxed and friendly environment? Interested in self-improvement through deliberate practice? Want to see what you can learn from fellow programmers, and teach them what you know? Then Leeds Code Dojo is for you!
            </p>

            <br/>
            <p>From newbie Node coders to hardcore Haskell hackers, and all the levels of C#, Java, Ruby, Python or F# inbetween, all languages and abilities are welcome.</p>

            <h2>When?</h2>

            <h4>Next: Build you a Skynet - An introduction to Machine Learning with Digit Recognisers: Wednesday 1st October</h4>

            <p>
                Want to build a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)"> skynet</a>, but don't know where to start?</p>

            <p>
                In this brief introduction to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning"> Machine Learning</a>, we'll be writing our very own digit recognition systems using the simplest of ML algorithms, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm"> k-nearest neighbours</a>. the goal of this exercise is to take images of handwritten single digits, and determine what those digits are.</p>

            <p>
                Although it may sound tricky, it's actually fairly straightforward, and we'll have template solutions in several languages (C#, F#, Python, PHP, Ruby and Java) to help get us going.  Any other language and you'll have to start from scratch, although it's still achievable in the time.
            </p>

            <p>
                After that, you should be well on your way to creating your very own self-aware Global Digital Defence Network with which to destroy humanity!  But if you get a re-programmed T-101 coming back through time and trying to stop you, you're on your own..
            </p>

            <p>
                Doors are open from 18:00, the night will kick off at 18:30 with pizza and chat.  We'll get started on the coding at 19:00 with a brief introduction to Machine Learning and the night's problem.  We'll code in pairs, using whatever languages people have available - so bring your (fully charged) laptop, if you have one, with your language of choice installed.
            </p>

            <p>Please <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Leeds-Code-Dojo/events/205340312/"> register on meetup</a> if you'd like to attend.</p>

            <h4>Previous: Word Wrap Kata - Wednesday 3rd September</h4>

            <p>
                We paired up to tackle another problem using TDD and Pair Programming, this time looking at implementing a Word Wrap algorithm.  This takes a line of text and wraps it to a certain length - similar to how Notepad and other text editors work.
            </p>
            <p>
                As usual, there were several languages in use - C#, Python, and PHP, with a couple of folk trying out something new.  We also tried out the 'test list' technique, where you maintain a list of tests throughout the session, crossing them off and adding more as you go.
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem proved fairly interesting, with a few different techniques emerging - recursion seemed to work well and produce fairly simple solutions, and some people chose to return collections of strings with others going for a block of text.  The initial choice of test (and therefore implementation path) seemed to have quite a bit impact on how easy it was to get to a working solution.
