            <h2>What?</h2>

            <p>Leeds Code Dojo is a group dedicated to programming.  We focus on practical coding sessions, where you can learn by doing.</p>

            <p>
                Want to have some fun coding in a relaxed and friendly environment? Interested in self-improvement through deliberate practice? Want to see what you can learn from fellow programmers, and teach them what you know? Then Leeds Code Dojo is for you!
            </p>

            </figure>

            <br/>
            <p>From newbie Node coders to hardcore Haskell hackers, and all the levels of C#, Java, Ruby, Python or F# inbetween, all languages and abilities are welcome.</p>

            <h2>When?</h2>

            <h4>Next: The Next Dojo: Wednesday 3rd September</h4>

            <p>
                This will be a practical coding session in the classic dojo style, where we pick a simple programming problem, then work on it together using the eXtreme Programming practices of TDD and Pair Programming.
            </p>

            <p>
                Doors are open from 18:00, and the night will kick off at 18:30 with pizza and socialising.  We'll get started on the coding at 19:00 with a brief overview of the techniques we'll be using and a description of the problem.  We'll code in pairs, using whatever languages people have available - so bring your laptop, if you have one, with your language of choice installed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Try to ensure you have some way of running unit tests.  Power sockets are also very limited, so try and come fully charged!
            </p>

            <p>Please <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Leeds-Code-Dojo/events/199361612/"> register on meetup</a> if you'd like to attend.</p>

            <h4>Previous: Fore! A nice round of Code Golf: Tuesday 5th August</h4>

            <p>
                We had a great round of code gold, with several languages represented - C#, Ruby, Python and Haskell.  We coded up solutions to <a href="http://golf.shinh.org/p.rb?99+shinichiroes+of+hamaji">output the '99 bottles' song</a>, then made them as small as possible!
            </p>
            <p>
                As you might predict, the Ruby and Python solutions were initially much smaller at 400-odd characters, but it was quite a struggle to get them down to the ultimate winner at 257 characters.  The C# and Haskell solutions on the other hand started out much larger at 1000-plus chars, but ended up only 50 or so characters behind the scripting languages.  It was an exciting race to the finish line!
