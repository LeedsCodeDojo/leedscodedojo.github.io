            <h2>What?</h2>

            <p>Leeds Code Dojo is a group dedicated to programming.  We focus on practical coding sessions, where you can learn by doing.</p>

            <p>
                Want to have some fun coding in a relaxed and friendly environment? Interested in self-improvement through deliberate practice? Want to see what you can learn from fellow programmers, and teach them what you know? Then Leeds Code Dojo is for you!

            <br/>
            <p>From newbie Node coders to hardcore Haskell hackers, and all the levels of C#, Java, Ruby, Python or F# inbetween, all languages and abilities are welcome.</p>

            <h2>When?</h2>

            <h4>Next: Refuctoring - Wednesday 3rd December</h4>

            <p>Details to come - please <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Leeds-Code-Dojo/events/218618851/"> see meetup</a> for further info and to register.</p>

            <h4>Previous: The Pipe Packing Challenge - Thursday 6th November</h4>

            <p>
                In a coding session that took inspiration from the last <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Leeds-Sharp/events/199532112/">leeds sharp session</a>, five pairs of us wrote algorithms to try and solve a simplified version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem">bin packing problem.</a></p>
            <p>
                There were once again many languages in effect - Erlang, F#, C# and Haskell - and all of the pairs had a working solution by the end.  Most ended up with a 'First Fit' algorithm, which does a pretty good job of finding a solution to this NP-Hard problem without taking the age of the universe to run..
            </p>

            <p>
                Most of the <a href="https://github.com/LeedsCodeDojo/PipePacking">solutions are up on github</a> - go check them out!
            </p>

            <h4>Previous: Build you a Skynet - Wednesday 1st October</h4>

            <p>
                We worked in twos and threes to write Machine Learning algorithms based on the k-nearest neighbours algorithm.  The group did well, with almost everyone getting a working solution, and some teams getting to over 90% accuracy with their digit classification!
            </p>
            <p>
                As usual, there were several languages in use - F#, Objective C, Scala, C#, and Python, and again a few people got involved with a new language, so well done to them.
